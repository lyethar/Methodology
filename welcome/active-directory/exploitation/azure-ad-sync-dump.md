# Azure AD Sync Dump

I am not sure that if you need to be an "Azure Admin" in order to dump this SQL password, however, nowhere in the tutorial does it mention that you need to be in this group.&#x20;

All you need is to have the folder in Program Files/ Microsoft Azure AD Sync folder.&#x20;

I already have this exploit in my WindowsTools folder but the way you exploit this is by transferring the dll and the exe. Change Paths to the “C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Sync\Bin” directory and execute the exploit.
