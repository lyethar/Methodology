# IRC Enumeration

IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat, this application allows the users to text eachother through different channels.&#x20;

The tool for the trade will be: Hexchat.&#x20;

In order to connect to the correct server, we have to add a new network by providing a new IP address and a port.&#x20;

Upon connection we are able to see different chats by scanning different channels.&#x20;

To scan for different channels we change the frequency at the bottom, and download the list. Moreover we see that when we connect to a channel we are able to chat with people. This helped us in UT99, we found out that the person we were chatting with broadcasted a message that allowed us to see that the server was running Unreal Tournament 99 and then from there we exploited this.&#x20;

In conclusion by enumerating chat messages we see what people are saying and maybe somebody gives up a certain vulnerable service.&#x20;

Here is the example I mentioned before and how we exploited it.&#x20;
