# SNMP Enumeration

SNMP Enumeration is crucial because using different commands one can determine the networking interfaces, version, and other useful information that can easily be exploited.

Useful Command: **snmp-check \<IP>**

This command was really useful, in ClamAV from Proving Grounds, the snmp-check command allowed us to check for the running ClamAV service running on the computer which allowed us to exploit it.&#x20;
