# Bypassing Proxies

If the chance is that there is a webserver that is a proxy and nothing else, we should use spose.py to properly scan the services behind the proxy.&#x20;

```python
python3 spose.py --proxy http://192.168.143.189:3128 --target 127.0.0.1
Using proxy address http://192.168.143.189:3128
127.0.0.1 3306 seems OPEN 
127.0.0.1 8080 seems OPEN 
```

Afterwards the only thing that is left for us to do is.&#x20;

Once that is done we can visit their website in this case by visiting 127.0.0.1:8080 with our proxy enabled.&#x20;
