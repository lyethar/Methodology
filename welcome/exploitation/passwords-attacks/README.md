# Passwords Attacks

So if we have found some usernames I want you to try these on all different ports&#x20;

* [ ] \<user>:\<user> ie. admin:admin
* [ ] \<boxname>:\<boxname>
* [ ] \<user>:\<rockyou.txt>
* [ ] \<user>:password
* [ ] \<user>:admin

We could also attempt to make a userlist and passlist to spray using hydra.

Useful lists:

/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt

/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best15.txt

Cewl can be used in websites to generate passwords that contain words from the public facing website.&#x20;
